NoBus
=====

Your favorite application requires dbus, uses it for nothing important,
and gives no option to disable it?

Forcing you to waste disk space and run an unnecessary daemon?


Fear no more, for NoBus is here!


Usage
=====

NoBus is a compile-time solution containing dbus stubs. Install it before
building your application, and the binary won't have any requirement
on dbus.
